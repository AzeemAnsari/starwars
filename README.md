## Introduction
This is a code repository for the ReactJs StarWars Character Search Application. 

In this app, I have used  https://swapi.dev/api/people/?search=xxxx api to fetch Star Wars Characters.

### Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the development server
